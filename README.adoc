= lsinv

The `lsinv.sh` `bash`-script allows on linux machines running an avahi-daemon and having avahi-utils
installed to list all available ITxPT inventory services. The default output is generated as a ```JSON``` array.

== Prerequisits

* The following tools need to be installed:
    ** avahi-daemon
    ** avahi-utils (for avahi-browse) 
    ** grepcidr 
    ** jq

* avahi-daemon disable for IPv6

== Usage

Download repository and use tool directly from installation folder or copy ```/usr/local/bin```:
[,shell]
----
./lsinv.h
----

== Known issues

* Due to optional fields and the fact that JSON allows unsorted fields the CSV output is unreliable
